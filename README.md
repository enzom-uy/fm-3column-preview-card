### Welcome! 👋👋
My name is Enzo Muñoz, I'm a Front-end developer. I'm currently using Frontend Mentor to test and prove my skills, from the most basic to actual challenges for me. 
I'll be updating this repo while I'm working on it, along with providing live previews thanks to Github Pages 😃.

In this case I made a basic three columns preview cards, this was a simple challenge since I only hard to use basic CSS and of course HTML, but later on I will upload this same "mini-project" made entirely with React (this is something I plan to do with all the ones I make 😁).
